# "The youngest bilingual Canadians: Insights from the 2016 Census about children aged 0-9"


This is the code for the census-based analysis of the number of bilingual children in Canada. You can find the associated OSF project at: https://osf.io/2gzfw/?view_only=6bb3c29473f44a9fb4da211582573f2d


## Repository Overview


  - `00_scripts` contains the R code to analyze the census data
  - `01_datasets` contains the 2016 publicly accessible micro files for the census. These can be downloaded from ODESI if you are affiliated with a Canadian University.
  - `02_map_data` contains map data downloaded by the Rscript (very large files) not uploaded to github due to file size constraints. If you execute the prep_map_2016.Rmd script, these will be downloaded to your computer
  - `03_output` contains Figures & Tables generated by the script


## Getting started

The prep_map script needs to be run only once on each computer. Runs kind of long (5-10min?).
For both the hierarchical and individuals scripts you need to download the data files from odesi first (this is described in the script).
